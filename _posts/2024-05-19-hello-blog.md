summary: Why I set up this GitHub Pages blog and how to add new notes.

I set up this Jekyll site to document experiments, scripts, and troubleshooting notes so I can revisit them without digging through chat logs or repos. Posts live in `_posts/` using the `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md` naming pattern. Draft ideas can stay in `_drafts/` until they're ready to publish.

To preview locally:

```bash
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Open `http://localhost:4000` to review changes. Each time I learn something, I'll write down the context, the commands or code that solved it, and a quick takeaway section at the end.
